Program to demonstrate students randomly selecting a station to visit

In a random order, students choose a station they haven't visited yet.
If all such stations are full, the student checks if any student at any
of those stations can swap to another station.  If not, the program
bails out and prints the ending state. (Students do not attempt swaps
of length greater than one.)

Tentative result: the last round usually (if not always) ends up with
a student unable to visit their last station.
